# Coolighter

A collaborative web content highlighter, distributed over Nostr

## Getting Started

You can run this example using the following steps:

1. Install project dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Build the project with `npm run build:dev` or `npm run build`
1. Start the Highlighter experience with `npm start` - this runs a collab server and renders the Highlighter experience

Note: If the client is not reachable on `http://localhost:8080` after `npm start` command above, open a new shell and try `npm run start:client`
